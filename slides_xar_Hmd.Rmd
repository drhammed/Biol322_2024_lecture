# Testing Hypothesis of Linear Regression

---
# Goals of the lecture

- **Understand the assumptions underlying a regression model.**

- **Understand the implications of violating assumptions and what to do when assumptions are violated.**

- **Evaluate regression model assumptions through visual representations and statistical tests.**

- **Understand the concepts of outliers, and influential points.**

- **Identifying observations within regression models.**


---

# INTRODUCTION


- Recall that our linear regression model can be defined as:

$$ Y = X\beta  +  \epsilon $$

where: $Y$ = response, $X$ = predictor(s), $\beta$ = coefficient(s), $\epsilon$ = error term

--


- We then use that equation to estimate our $\beta$ parameter(s) and noted that the,the individual estimates $\hat{\beta}_j$ are typically assumed to follow a **normal distribution** with _mean_ $\beta_j$ and _variance_. 
Such that:
$$\hat{\beta}_j \sim N\left(\beta_j, \sigma^2 M_{jj}  \right)$$
where:

**mean** $=$ $\beta_j$, 

**variance** $=$  $\sigma^2 M_{jj}$

**M** $=$ $\left(X^\top X\right)^{-1}$


---
# INTRODUCTION

- Multiple metrics, including $R^2$, and **RMSE** are used to assess the adequacy of our model in capturing the underlying patterns in our data. Each of these metrics, to some extent, revolves around the expression:
$$\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

where $y_i$ is the observed value and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value.


- So, technically, they gauge the goodness of fit. But, what about the assumptions underlying the model?



--

_**So, do we really care about how well our model fits the data?**_ 

--

- If you want to make inference from the model, then our considerations become crucial.

# Assumptions of Linear Regression Models

# Assumptions of linear regression

Basically, model assumptions are explicitly embedded in a model statement,

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_{p-1} x_{i(p-1)} + \epsilon_i$$

where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2).$


And the assumptions can be represented as **LINE**:

--
- **L**inearity: the response is a linear combination of the predictors. (With noise about this true linear relationship.)

--
- **I**ndependence: the errors are independent of each other.

--
- **N**ormality: the distribution of the errors typically follow a normal distribution.

--
- **E**quality of Variance: the variance of error is the same at any set of predictor values.


---

# Assumptions of linear regression

- The linearity assumption is encoded as

$$\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_{p-1} x_{i(p-1)}$$

- while the remaining three, are all encoded in

$$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

the $\epsilon_i$ are $iid$ normal random variables with equal variance.


- If these assumptions are satisfied, then that's **excellent**! We can make inference, and our conclusions will be reliable.

--

- However, if these assumptions are not fulfilled, we can still perform some test (e.g.,  a t-test in R), but the outcomes will lack **validity**. The distributions of parameter estimates will deviate from expectations, leading to erroneous acceptance or rejection of hypotheses.

---

# How do we assess our model assumptions?



## 1. Fitted vs Residuals Plot

This is one of the most important metrics in checking model assumptions, especially for linearity and equal variance.


- To demonstrate this method, we can work with (simulated) data from three models:

--

$$\text{Model A:} \quad Y = 2 + 10x + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, 1)$$

$$ \text{Model B:} \quad Y = 2 + 10x + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, x^2)$$

$$\text{Model C:} \quad Y = 2 + 10x^2 + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, 16)$$


--
_**Which of the three models defined above do you think would not violate the assumptions?**_



---
# Define the function for the models

```{r, echo = TRUE}

mod_1 = function(sample_size = 1000) {
  x = runif(n = sample_size) * 10
  y = 2 + 10 * x + rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  data.frame(x, y)
}

mod_2 = function(sample_size = 1000) {
  x = runif(n = sample_size) * 10
  y = 2 + 10 * x + rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 0, sd = x)
  data.frame(x, y)
}

mod_3 = function(sample_size = 1000) {
  x = runif(n = sample_size) * 10
  y = 2 + 10 * x ^ 2 + rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 0, sd = 4)
  data.frame(x, y)
}
```


---
# Evaluate model assumptions using plots

- Let's demonstrate Fitted vs residual plot using (simulated) data from the three models:

Recall that we said model A will show almost no sign of model violation, we can use that to demonstrate what a "good" plot looks like.


```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(99)
data_1 = mod_1()
head(data_1)

```

---
# Evaluate model assumptions using plots

- Now, let's fit the model and add the fitted line to the scatterplot.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(y ~ x, data = data_1, col = "grey", pch = 20, main = "Model A")
fit_1 = lm(y ~ x, data = data_1)
abline(fit_1, col = "darkred", lwd = 3)
```

---
# Evaluate model assumptions using plots

- Plot a fitted vs residuals plot.  



```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(fitted(fit_1), resid(fit_1), col = "grey", pch = 20,
     xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Model A")
abline(h = 0, col = "darkred", lwd = 2)
```



---

# Evaluate model assumptions using plots

Two things here:
        
        1. For each fitted value, the average of the residuals should be approximately zero. This validates the assumption of *linearity*. To highlight this, it's common practice to include a horizontal line at $y = 0$.
        2. At every fitted value, the spread/dispersion of the residuals should be relatively consistent. If so, the assumption of *equal variance* holds true.

--
In this instance, we can observe that both conditions are satisfied. The residuals are centered around zero, and the spread of the residuals is consistent across the range of fitted values. 

--

This suggests that the assumptions of linearity and equal variance are **not violated**.


---

# Model B

Now, lets check an instance where  one of the assumptions is violated. We can use *model B** for this purpose. 

```{css echo=FALSE}
.side-note {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  right: 10px;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  width: 300px; 
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(99)
data_2 = mod_2()
fit_2 = lm(y ~ x, data = data_2)
plot(y ~ x, data = data_2, col = "grey", pch = 20, main = "Model B")
abline(fit_2, col = "darkred", lwd = 3)
```

--
<div class="side-note">
      <p>
        In this case, the variance is larger for larger values of the predictor variable $x$. This is a clear indication that the assumption of equal variance is violated.
      </p>

</div>  


---

# Model B


```{css echo=FALSE}
.side-note {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  right: 10px;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  width: 300px; 
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```



```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(fitted(fit_2), resid(fit_2), col = "grey", pch = 20,
     xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Model B")
abline(h = 0, col = "darkred", lwd = 2)
```

--

<div class="side-note">
      <p>
        Here, two observations are obvious here. Firstly, the residuals appear to be roughly centered around 0 for any given fitted value, indicating that the linearity assumption holds. However, it's also evident that for higher fitted values, the spread of the residuals increases noticeably, indicating a violation of the constant variance assumption. 
      </p>

</div>    



---

```{css echo=FALSE}
.side-note {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  right: 10px;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  width: 300px; 
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.plot-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Add space between the plots */
}

.plot-container img {
  width: 300%; 
}
```


# Model C

- Next, we will illustrate a model that fails to satisfy the linearity assumption. **Model C** serves as an example where $(Y)$ is not a linear combination of the predictors. In this scenario, the predictor is $(x)$, but the model incorporates $(x^2)$.

--
- plot the fitted vs residual plot for model C.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

set.seed(99)
data_3 = mod_3()
fit_3 = lm(y ~ x, data = data_3)


#par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 
plot(y ~ x, data = data_3, col = "grey", pch = 20, main = "Model C")
abline(fit_3, col = "darkred", lwd = 3)

```

---
# Model C

```{css echo=FALSE}
.side-note {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  right: 10px;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  width: 300px; 
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}


plot(fitted(fit_3), resid(fit_3), col = "grey", pch = 20,
     xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Model C")
abline(h = 0, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)



```


--

<div class="side-note">
      <p>
        Here, we can see that the equal variance assumption is met. However, the linearity assumption is violated. The residuals are not centered around zero for any given fitted value. This is a clear indication that the model is not capturing the true relationship between the predictors and the response.
      </p>

</div>

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

2. The **xaringan** package;

3. The **remark.js** Wiki;


Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

---

# remark.js

You can see an introduction of remark.js from [its homepage](https://remarkjs.com). You should read the [remark.js Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) at least once to know how to

- create a new slide (Markdown syntax<sup>*</sup> and slide properties);

- format a slide (e.g. text alignment);

- configure the slideshow;

- and use the presentation (keyboard shortcuts).

It is important to be familiar with remark.js before you can understand the options in **xaringan**.

.footnote[[*] It is different with Pandoc's Markdown! It is limited but should be enough for presentation purposes. Come on... You do not need a slide for the Table of Contents! Well, the Markdown support in remark.js [may be improved](https://github.com/gnab/remark/issues/142) in the future.]

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

Provides an R Markdown output format `xaringan::moon_reader` as a wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata, e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "A Cool Presentation"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    yolo: true
    nature:
      autoplay: 30000
---
```

See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for all possible options that you can use.

---

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;
]

.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# R Code

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
dojutsu = c('地爆天星', '天照', '加具土命', '神威', '須佐能乎', '無限月読')
grep('天', dojutsu, value = TRUE)
```

---

# R Plots

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

# HTML Widgets

I have not thoroughly tested HTML widgets against **xaringan**. Some may work well, and some may not. It is a little tricky.

Similarly, the Shiny mode (`runtime: shiny`) does not work. I might get these issues fixed in the future, but these are not of high priority to me. I never turn my presentation into a Shiny app. When I need to demonstrate more complicated examples, I just launch them separately. It is convenient to share slides with other people when they are plain HTML/JS applications.

See the next page for two HTML widgets.

---

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17)
```

---

```{r eval=require('DT'), tidy=FALSE}
DT::datatable(
  head(iris, 10),
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)
)
```

---

# Some Tips

- Do not forget to try the `yolo` option of `xaringan::moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        yolo: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- Slides can be automatically played if you set the `autoplay` option under `nature`, e.g. go to the next slide every 30 seconds in a lightning talk:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay: 30000
    ```

- If you want to restart the play after it reaches the last slide, you may set the sub-option `loop` to TRUE, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay:
            interval: 30000
            loop: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- A countdown timer can be added to every page of the slides using the `countdown` option under `nature`, e.g. if you want to spend one minute on every page when you give the talk, you can set:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          countdown: 60000
    ```

    Then you will see a timer counting down from `01:00`, to `00:59`, `00:58`, ... When the time is out, the timer will continue but the time turns red.
    
---

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

---

# Some Tips


.pull-left[
An example using a leading `*`:

    ```r
    if (TRUE) {
    ** message("Very important!")
    }
    ```
Output:
```r
if (TRUE) {
* message("Very important!")
}
```

This is invalid R code, so it is a plain fenced code block that is not executed.
]

.pull-right[
An example using `{{}}`:

````
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
*{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```
````
Output:
```{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```

It is valid R code so you can run it. Note that `{{}}` can wrap an R expression of multiple lines.
]

---

# Some Tips

An example of using the trailing comment `#<<` to highlight lines:

````markdown
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```
````

Output:

```{r tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```

---

# Some Tips

When you enable line-highlighting, you can also use the chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output from a code chunk. For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines, and `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.

````md
`r ''````{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3)}
head(iris)
```
````

```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3), echo=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

Question: what does `highlight.output = c(TRUE, FALSE)` mean? (Hint: think about R's recycling of vectors)

---

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.

---

# Macros

- remark.js [allows users to define custom macros](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/80) (JS functions) that can be applied to Markdown text using the syntax `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...]` or `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...](this)`. For example, before remark.js initializes the slides, you can define a macro named `scale`:

    ```js
    remark.macros.scale = function (percentage) {
      var url = this;
      return '<img src="' + url + '" style="width: ' + percentage + '" />';
    };
    ```

    Then the Markdown text

    ```markdown
    ![:scale 50%](image.jpg)
    ```

    will be translated to
    
    ```html
    <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 50%" />
    ```

---

# Macros (continued)

- To insert macros in **xaringan** slides, you can use the option `beforeInit` under the option `nature`, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          beforeInit: "macros.js"
    ```

    You save your remark.js macros in the file `macros.js`.

- The `beforeInit` option can be used to insert arbitrary JS code before `remark.create()`. Inserting macros is just one of its possible applications.

---

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# CSS (with Sass)

**xaringan** also supports Sass support via **rmarkdown**. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a `.scss` file, say `mytheme.scss`, using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax with variables:

```scss
$mycolor: #ff0000; 
.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }
.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "mytheme.scss"]
```

This requires **rmarkdown** >= 2.8 and the [**sass**](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/) package. You can learn more about **rmarkdown** and **sass** support in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/15/2021-spring-rmd-news/#sass-and-scss-support-for-html-based-output) and in [**sass** overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html).

---

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).

# Sharingan

The R package name **xaringan** was derived<sup>1</sup> from **Sharingan**, a dōjutsu in the Japanese anime _Naruto_ with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience.<sup>2,3</sup>

.footnote[
[1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of _X_ is _Sh_ /ʃ/ (as in _shrimp_). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name _Xie_.

[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.

[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations.

# Naruto terminology

The **xaringan** package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as

- [Sharingan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan) (写輪眼; the package name)

- The [moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Reader) (月読; an attractive R Markdown output format)

- [Chakra](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra) (查克拉; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)

- [Nature transformation](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Nature_Transformation) (性質変化; transform the chakra by setting different options)

- The [infinite moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi) (無限月読; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)

- The [summoning technique](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique) (download remark.js from the web)

You can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu "Moon Reader" may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.
